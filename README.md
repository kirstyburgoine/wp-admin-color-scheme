### TODO:

- [ ] Create colour palette of SASS variables and replace hex codes.
- [ ] Look at simplifying colour usage (removing the very specific chains of selectors currently in the plugin).
- [ ] Include correct PostCSS configuration.
- [ ] Look at implementing CSS Custom Properties.
- [ ] And probably loads more tasks still too :)
